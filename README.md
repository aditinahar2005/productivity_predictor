# Productivity Activity Recommender

This project is a personal experiment using my own productivity data to recommend the best activity for any given moment—whether it’s time to study, exercise, socialize, relax, sleep, or work. I built this to better understand my habits and to learn how data science and web development can come together to create something useful and interactive.

## Why I Built This

I’ve always been curious about how my daily routines affect my productivity and well-being. By logging my activities and moods, I wanted to see if I could use that data to make smarter decisions about what to do next. This project was a way to combine my interest in self-improvement with my desire to learn more about full-stack development and machine learning.

## What I Learned

- **Data Science:** Preprocessing real-world, messy data and training models for predictions.
- **Web Development:** Building a modern, responsive frontend with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **APIs:** Creating a Python Flask backend to serve predictions and visualizations.
- **Deployment:** Deploying both frontend and backend for public access.
- **Personal Insight:** Analyzing my own data gave me new perspectives on my habits.
